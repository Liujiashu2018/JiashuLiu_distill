The graph below is a grouped bar graph, presenting the number of birds in the rural and urban area of each bioregion in Austrilia respectively. The bird_count should be a binary factor indicating whether a given species was present or absent at a bird bath. However, I calculated the number of occurance of birds at bath by cumulating the bird_count and grouping the data by bioregions and rural_urban area. it is well noticed that in Sydney Basin, bird baths present more in the urban area rather than rural area. There are also a lot NA in this dataset, which I think is attributed to the difficulty of collecting the data.\n\n\nbird_baths%>%\n  group_by(bioregions, urban_rural)%>%\n  summarise(cumulative_bird_count=sum(bird_count))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(y=bioregions, x=cumulative_bird_count, fill=urban_rural))+\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\")+\n  labs(y=\"Bioregions\", x=\"Occurance of birds at bath\", title = \"Number of birds in the rural and urban area of each bioregion\")+\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
