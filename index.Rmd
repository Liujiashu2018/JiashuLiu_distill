## About me

Hello! I'm currently a senior student double-major in Economics and Applied Math & Statistics at Macalester College, and will graduate in Spring 2022. I enjoy learning data visualization and R programming language. I'm also interested in the application of machine learning to economics, especially towards international trade topics.
